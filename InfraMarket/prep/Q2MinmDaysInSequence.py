# Minimum Days to Make n Bouquets (Sequential Plucking Constraint) - Follow Up of 1st question
You are given an unsorted array bloomDay, where bloomDay[i] represents the day on which the flower 
at index i will bloom.

You are also given:

n â†’ number of bouquets to make
k â†’ number of adjacent flowers required per bouquet

ðŸ›‘ New Constraint:

You cannot pluck any flower at position i until all previous flowers (0 to i-1) have been plucked â€”
i.e., you must pluck flowers in order from left to right.

Return the minimum number of days required to make n bouquets, where each bouquet contains exactly 
k adjacent bloomed flowers, and all flowers before index i must be plucked before plucking flower i.

If it's not possible, return -1.

Example:
Input:
bloomDay = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2]
n = 2
k = 2

Output:
10
Explanation:
You must pluck flowers from left to right.
By day 10, the bloomDay becomes: [1âœ“, 10âœ“, 3âœ“, 10âœ“, 2âœ“]
Valid bouquets possible: [1,10] and [3,10] â€” both adjacent and sequentially plucked.

Constraints:
1 <= bloomDay.length <= 10^5
1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9
1 <= n <= 10^6
1 <= k <= bloomDay.length
